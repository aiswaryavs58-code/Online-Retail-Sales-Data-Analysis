🛒 Online Retail Sales Data Analysis

Turning raw sales data into clear business insights.

This project analyzes online retail sales data to understand customer buying behavior, sales trends, and product performance, and then provides simple recommendations to help improve business decisions.

📊 Project Overview

The Problem:
The retail business had a large amount of sales data, but the data was messy and difficult to understand. Important questions like what sells the most, when sales are higher, and where customers come from were not clear.

The Goal:
To clean the data, analyze it, and clearly explain:

Sales patterns

Customer behavior

Business improvement opportunities

The Outcome:
Raw and confusing data was converted into meaningful insights that can help the business plan inventory, sales, and marketing better.

💡 Key Findings
1️⃣ A Few Products Drive Most Sales

Only a small number of products generate the majority of revenue. These products are the main contributors to business income.

2️⃣ Sales Are Higher in Specific Countries

Customers from certain countries place more orders and contribute more to total sales than others.

3️⃣ Sales Increase During Certain Periods

Sales are not the same throughout the year. Some months show higher demand, indicating seasonal buying patterns.

4️⃣ Repeat Customers Exist

Many customers make multiple purchases, showing opportunities for customer loyalty and repeat sales.

5️⃣ Clean Data Makes Better Decisions

After removing incorrect and duplicate records, the analysis became more accurate and trustworthy.
